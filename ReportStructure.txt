1. Introduction
Purpose: Provide a clear overview of the problem you're tackling and the objective of your project.

  What is the problem?
    Define the problem in one or two sentences:
    "This project aims to detect fake news articles based on the content of the articles using machine learning algorithms."
    Why is this problem important?
    Explain the societal relevance of fake news detection: "The spread of fake news is a critical issue in todayâ€™s digital age, affecting public opinion and decision-making."
    What are the expected outcomes of your model?
    State the specific goal of your project, focusing on performance metrics (accuracy, F1-score, etc.): "The goal is to develop a model that can accurately classify news articles as either real or fake, with a focus on achieving an F1-score of at least 0.85."
